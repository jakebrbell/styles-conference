# Learn to Code HTML & CSS
### By Shay Howe

If you're looking for practice with HTML and CSS, I highly recommend Shay Howe's lessons and tutorials. Shay, a designer and front-end developer, has created both a beginner course as well as an advanced course. He has a way of clearly explaining the concepts behind HTML and CSS and structuring the lessons so they build on each other in a way that makes sense.

The beginner's course walks you through building the Styles Conference website. Here's how Shay describes the project: "As web designers and front-end developers, we have the luxury of attending a number of great conferences dedicated to our craft. Weâ€™re going to make up our own conference, Styles Conference, and build a website for it."
